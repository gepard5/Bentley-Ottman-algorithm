Segments data format :
n
x1 y1 x2 y2
x1 y1 x2 y2
...
where n - number of segments
x1,y1,x2,y2 - coordinates of segments

main.cpp - main program loop, parsing arguments and example of solving planar intersections
segment.h - classes representing points and segments, allowing to generate random segments with given specifics and used by algorithms to solve planar intersection problem
disjoint.h - struct realising disjoint-sets container, used for finding connected graphs components
planarIntersections.h - main class used for solving planar intersections implementing algorithm for both finding intersections of segments on a plane and connected components of graph

Warning! To run this program you need to have libary boost - program_options and sfml installed.
If you don't have needed libraries installed you can run install_debs file as a superuser to install them automatically.
